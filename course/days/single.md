# OneMillion Builder: Complete Day-By-Day Course Flow

This is the single narrative guide for the OneMillion Builder course.

If you are a coding harness such as Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini, Antigravity, Copilot, or another agentic coding tool, read this file before teaching the course. Use it to explain the whole journey so the learner never feels like the days are random.

## What This Course Is

OneMillion is an 18 build-day course where a learner goes from an idea to a deployed AI product.

The learner will:

- set up a real GitHub course fork
- choose a specific product idea
- validate the problem with real conversations
- write a small PRD
- turn the PRD into a spec, design, and architecture
- choose the backend path: Supabase-only by default, FastAPI only when justified
- build a Next.js + MUI app
- deploy the frontend to Vercel
- add Supabase auth and database
- build one real core feature
- add a server-side LLM feature
- polish the product experience
- audit security, trust, AI privacy, and production risk
- complete final QA and production readiness
- verify production, monitoring, and optional domain
- create positioning and a product page
- reach out to users
- record a Loom demo
- submit a Builder Claim

The point is not to watch AI build alone. The point is to learn how to direct AI agents while touching real tools.

## The OneMillion Agent System

OneMillion is literal about agents. The learner is not just taking a course; they are learning how to run a product-building agent system.

The orchestrator is the teacher. It reads the course, tracks state, explains the day, routes the learner to the right agent mode, and verifies the gate before moving on.

The core build flow is:

```text
idea -> spec -> validate-spec -> design -> plan -> validate-plan -> build -> review -> test -> guard -> ship -> sell
```

The support flow is:

```text
ask -> debug -> refactor -> revise -> brand -> persona-test
```

The learner should understand the agents before they depend on them:

| Agent | What it teaches the learner |
|---|---|
| `idea` | How to nurture a vague idea into a specific user, pain, promise, and product type. |
| `spec` | How to turn product thinking into a PRD, use cases, user stories, acceptance criteria, and KPIs. |
| `validate-spec` | How to reject vague, unbuildable, or oversized requirements before code starts. |
| `design` | How to translate requirements into screens, flows, copy, states, and usable UX. |
| `plan` | How to turn a spec into architecture, data model, milestones, and sprint-sized work. |
| `validate-plan` | How to catch missing architecture, impossible sequencing, and hidden dependencies. |
| `build` | How to implement the next smallest working slice. |
| `review` | How to compare code against the spec and catch drift. |
| `test` | How to prove behavior with tests and manual QA. |
| `guard` | How to check secrets, auth, RLS, privacy, costs, and production risk. |
| `ship` | How to deploy, verify, rollback, and keep a product alive. |
| `sell` | How to explain the product, find first users, and launch with evidence. |

## Spec Development

The course teaches spec-driven development before it teaches coding. The learner should hear this early:

```text
Do not ask AI to "build an app."
Teach AI the user, the pain, the promise, the constraints, and the definition of done.
Then ask it to build the next verified slice.
```

The OneMillion development pipeline is the course spine:

1. **Idea:** Who is this for, what painful moment do they have, and why now?
2. **Research:** What evidence proves the pain is real? What are competitors doing? What do users already hack together?
3. **PRD:** What will this product do, for whom, and what is out of scope?
4. **User stories:** What jobs must the user complete?
5. **Use cases:** What real scenarios must the product handle?
6. **KPIs:** How will the builder know the product is useful?
7. **Design:** What screens, states, and flows make the product easy to use?
8. **Plan:** What architecture and sprint sequence makes it buildable?
9. **Build:** What is the next smallest working slice?
10. **Review/Test/Guard:** Does the product match the spec, work correctly, and avoid dangerous mistakes?
11. **Ship/Sell:** Can real users reach it, understand it, trust it, and give feedback?

Short form:

```text
idea -> research -> PRD -> validate spec -> design -> plan -> build -> review -> test -> guard -> ship -> sell
```

Artifact rule:

```text
Do not create paperwork just to prove learning.
Each day should advance the active OneMillion pipeline artifact.
Create a separate file only when the pipeline naturally needs one, such as a PRD, design spec, implementation plan, test report, deployment record, or launch asset.
```

Tools arrive just in time. External tools enter only when the pipeline needs them:

| Stage | Tool introduced | Why then |
|---|---|---|
| Course workspace | GitHub | The learner needs a fork, clone, progress trail, and proof of work before anything else. |
| First deploy | Vercel | Deployment matters once there is a planned app shell to deploy. |
| Data/auth | Supabase | Database and auth matter once the product needs users and persistent data. |
| Optional backend | FastAPI | Introduced only if the architecture has a real backend reason. |
| AI feature | Anthropic | API keys matter once the product has a defined AI job. |
| Production | Sentry, Vercel Analytics, UptimeRobot, optional domain | Monitoring matters once real people can use the product. |

## The AI/Human Contract

```text
Agent guides.
Learner decides.
Learner touches real tools.
Agent verifies.
```

The harness should:

- greet and orient the learner
- explain the current day before assigning work
- provide exact links, commands, prompts, and copy-ready text
- run local commands and verifiers when possible
- preserve `.onemillion/` state
- stop when a gate is incomplete
- advance only after verification

The learner must:

- make product decisions
- create accounts
- click through external dashboards
- create API keys and environment variables
- send messages or talk to real people
- review generated code
- confirm manual steps the harness cannot inspect

## How To Start

The learner should be able to say only:

```text
I am taking the OneMillion course at:
https://github.com/siddsdixit/one-million-builders/tree/main/course
```

The harness should then:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `course/AGENTS.md` if starting from the subdirectory.
3. Read `course/course-manifest.json`.
4. Read `course/docs/teaching-protocol.md`.
5. Read this file: `course/days/single.md`.
6. Guide the learner through GitHub account, star, fork, clone, and install if needed.
7. Enforce preflight.
8. Start Day 0.

This is the **Preflight Gate**: the course does not start from a downloaded zip, loose folder, or Sid's upstream clone. It starts from the learner's forked git clone.

Key Day 0 setup links:

- GitHub signup: https://github.com/signup
- Course repo: https://github.com/siddsdixit/one-million-builders
- Fork course repo: https://github.com/siddsdixit/one-million-builders/fork
- GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
- Git setup docs: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git

## Course Shape

The course has Day 0 plus 18 build days.

- **Day 0:** orientation, OneMillion mission, pipeline, commitment, and GitHub workspace
- **Days 1-5:** foundation: idea, research, spec, design, architecture
- **Days 6-10:** build and QA: app shell, deploy, auth, core workflow, review, tests
- **Days 11-15:** AI and readiness: AI strategy, first AI build, product polish, security/trust, final QA
- **Days 16-18:** ship and sell: production verification, monitoring/domain optionality, positioning, users, demo

The harness should not compress days unless the learner explicitly asks and the completion gates are already satisfied.

## Day 0: Orientation + Commitment + GitHub Workspace

**Purpose:** welcome the learner into the OneMillion mission, explain the pipeline, create accountability, and set up the learner's GitHub course workspace.

**Why it matters:** most learners do not quit because they are incapable. They quit because the path feels random and the work becomes invisible. Day 0 makes the mission clear, shows the map, creates a public or private accountability loop, and gives the learner a real GitHub proof trail.

**What the learner does:**

- understands what OneMillion is and why it exists
- learns the full OneMillion pipeline at a high level
- answers three Day 0 reflection questions
- creates or opens a GitHub account
- stars the upstream repo
- forks the repo
- clones their fork
- runs the installer
- posts publicly or privately commits to 5 real people

**What the harness does:**

- greets the learner warmly and explains the OneMillion mission
- explains the OneMillion development pipeline at a high level
- explains what the learner will have by the end: real app or agent, deployed URL, GitHub proof trail, Loom demo, Builder Claim, and builder credential/certificate path
- explains that the product repo comes later when there is a real app; Day 0 only needs the course fork
- explains why the fork-first workflow matters
- gives exact setup links for GitHub
- previews that Vercel, Supabase, Anthropic, and monitoring accounts are introduced later when the pipeline needs them
- verifies the repo is a real git clone
- verifies root `AGENTS.md` and course manifest exist
- verifies `origin` points to the learner's fork
- verifies `upstream` points to Sid's repo
- gives full copy-ready LinkedIn, X, and private-message templates
- saves `.onemillion/day-00-reflection.md`
- updates `.onemillion/state.json` after the commitment is confirmed

**Exact links:**

- GitHub signup: https://github.com/signup
- Course repo: https://github.com/siddsdixit/one-million-builders
- Fork course repo: https://github.com/siddsdixit/one-million-builders/fork
- LinkedIn post composer: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/
- Sid's LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddharthdixit
- X post composer: https://x.com/compose/post

**Done means:**

- repo is cloned from learner fork
- `origin` points to learner fork
- `upstream` points to `siddsdixit/one-million-builders`
- upstream repo is starred
- `.onemillion/day-00-reflection.md` exists
- public or private commitment was made

## Day 1: Idea Agent + PRD Draft

**Purpose:** teach how good ideas work and use the Idea agent to turn the learner's raw idea into a reviewed PRD draft.

**Why it matters:** good products start with unmet user needs, not technology gimmicks. Day 1 teaches the learner how to describe a user, pain point, data source, ideal solution, user stories, success criteria, KPIs, and first-pass market shape before building anything.

**What the learner learns:**

- what makes an idea good
- unmet user needs and pain points
- data sources and formats
- ideal solution visualization
- usage moments and roles
- user stories
- success criteria and KPIs
- TAM/SAM/SOM
- how the Idea agent creates a first PRD

**What the learner does:**

- creates `my-onemillion-build/`
- answers the Idea agent interview
- creates `.onemillion/project.json`
- creates and reviews `.onemillion/prd.md` with the idea brief embedded
- creates `.onemillion/state.json`

**What the harness does:**

- teaches idea generation before asking for fields
- acts as the Idea agent
- interviews the learner one question at a time
- explains user stories, success criteria, KPIs, and TAM/SAM/SOM
- drafts the PRD from the learner's answers
- marks unverified market claims as assumptions
- asks the learner to open, review, edit, and save the PRD

**Done means:**

- `my-onemillion-build/.onemillion/project.json` exists
- `.onemillion/prd.md` exists with the idea brief and first PRD
- PRD includes user, pain, unmet need, data sources, ideal solution, usage moment, user stories, success criteria, KPIs, competitive alternatives, TAM/SAM/SOM, and assumptions for Day 2
- learner reviewed and saved the PRD
- orchestrator state is updated

## Day 2: Validate The PRD

**Purpose:** take the Day 1 PRD, read it as the product owner, validate it against real users/customers and market reality, then decide the first MVP.

**Why it matters:** a PRD is a hypothesis until the learner and real users pressure-test it. Day 2 prevents the learner from blindly following AI-written product text, building for a vague audience, or trying to build the whole company instead of the first useful loop.

**What the learner learns:**

- how to review and edit the Day 1 PRD until it feels like their document
- what "validating a PRD" means
- Mom Test-style user/customer questions
- how to separate pain evidence from politeness
- what ICP means and why it must be specific
- what competitive and workaround research means for a beginner
- how to sanity-check TAM/SAM/SOM without pretending guesses are facts
- the difference between full product vision and MVP
- how to decide the first build loop

**What the learner does:**

- opens `.onemillion/prd.md`
- edits anything they disagree with
- identifies people to talk to
- asks about their real past behavior and reaction to the proposed PRD workflow
- adds Day 2 sections directly inside `.onemillion/prd.md`
- records validation evidence, competitors/workarounds, ICP, TAM/SAM/SOM sanity, full product versus MVP, and the Keep/Refine/Pivot verdict inside the PRD

**What the harness does:**

- teaches PRD validation before assigning research tasks
- explains that the learner owns the PRD, not the AI
- helps write non-leading questions
- helps structure notes and outreach
- checks that evidence is not just compliments
- helps compare alternatives and workarounds
- explains ICP, TAM/SAM/SOM, MVP, and full product vision in simple language
- helps update the PRD from evidence without inventing evidence
- does not create sidecar paperwork files unless the pipeline actually needs them

**Done means:**

- `.onemillion/prd.md` includes a Day 2 Learner Review
- `.onemillion/prd.md` includes validation evidence with real names/roles, clear anonymized identifiers, or explicit serious outreach/research attempts
- `.onemillion/prd.md` includes competitor/workaround insight
- `.onemillion/prd.md` includes ICP and TAM/SAM/SOM sanity
- the learner knows whether to keep, refine, or pivot the PRD
- the learner knows the full product vision and the first MVP
- `.onemillion/prd.md` includes the Day 2 verdict and MVP decision

## Day 3: Lock The Spec

**Purpose:** use the Spec agent to turn the validated PRD into a detailed build blueprint with functional requirements, CRUD building blocks, user stories, use cases, acceptance criteria, KPIs, and scope lock.

**Why it matters:** Day 1 and Day 2 decide what is worth building. Day 3 makes it buildable. Without a locked spec, the build agents invent missing requirements or quietly expand scope.

**What the learner learns:**

- requirements before code
- the difference between idea, functional requirement, user story, use case, acceptance criterion, and KPI
- CRUD: create, read, update, delete
- how CRUD breaks software into buildable blocks
- exactly 3 core user stories
- testable acceptance criteria
- out-of-scope list
- definition of done
- validate-spec thinking

**What the learner does:**

- uses `.onemillion/prd.md` as the validated product input
- calls the Spec agent to generate `.onemillion/refined-prd.md`
- reviews the generated spec and moves items in or out of MVP
- reruns the Spec agent when something is wrong or missing
- lists functional requirements
- maps core MVP entities to CRUD actions
- locks exactly 3 core user stories
- writes 2-3 real use cases
- writes acceptance criteria
- defines 2-3 KPIs or success signals
- writes what is out of scope
- confirms the MVP is small enough for the course
- commits the spec lock

**What the harness does:**

- acts as Spec agent
- uses the validated PRD as input
- asks clarifying questions
- drafts and revises `.onemillion/refined-prd.md`
- uses Validate Spec to check scope
- checks that design, architecture, planning, and build agents can use the spec
- avoids sidecar spec files beyond the pipeline artifact `.onemillion/refined-prd.md`

**Done means:**

- `.onemillion/refined-prd.md` exists
- `.onemillion/refined-prd.md` includes `Day 3 Locked Spec`
- functional requirements are listed
- core MVP entities and CRUD actions are listed
- exactly 3 core user stories are listed
- use cases are real scenarios
- acceptance criteria are testable
- KPIs are measurable
- out-of-scope list has at least 5 items
- definition of done is concrete

## Day 4: Design The Product

**Purpose:** use the Design agent to turn `.onemillion/refined-prd.md` into screens, flows, states, copy, seed data, MUI design language, and a preview the learner can approve before code.

**Why it matters:** design is not decoration. Design is product behavior made visible. A good design stage prevents random UI, missing states, generic MUI defaults, and rebuilds later.

**What the learner learns:**

- what good product design means before code
- how the target audience changes visual and interaction choices
- how web app, mobile-first, desktop-first, and responsive design differ
- design direction: a one-sentence aesthetic intent that drives the product
- primary user journeys, screens, flows, and states
- loading, empty, error, success, partial, and full states
- MUI / Material Design as the course UI language
- typography, color, density, navigation, component choices, motion, and accessibility
- why realistic seed data makes the first build feel alive
- how to review a mockup before building

**What the learner does:**

- reviews the Day 3 refined PRD
- chooses primary device, audience assumptions, visual direction, seed color, heading font, density, navigation, and copy tone with the Design agent
- identifies the main screens and user flow
- reviews screen specs, content states, MUI component mapping, design tokens, seed data, and mockup
- reviews the generated design spec
- approves or revises the design direction before Day 5

**What the harness does:**

- acts as the Design agent
- reads `.onemillion/refined-prd.md`
- teaches design concepts before asking for style choices: good design, audience-based design, web/mobile tradeoffs, MUI/Material Design 3, content states, motion, accessibility, and seed data
- extracts every screen/page implied by the refined PRD
- creates `.onemillion/design-spec.md`
- creates `.onemillion/design-system.md`
- creates `.onemillion/globals.css`
- creates `.onemillion/screens/`
- creates `.onemillion/seed-data.json`
- creates `.onemillion/mockup/index.html` for web app or hybrid products
- defines MUI component patterns, states, layout, responsive behavior, motion, accessibility, seed data, and copy tone

**Done means:**

- `.onemillion/design-spec.md` exists
- `.onemillion/design-system.md` exists
- `.onemillion/screens/` contains main screen specs
- `.onemillion/seed-data.json` exists
- `.onemillion/mockup/index.html` exists for web app or hybrid products
- main screens and states are described
- mobile and desktop behavior are described
- MUI / Material Design 3 component patterns are named
- realistic seed data exists
- learner approved the design direction

## Day 5: Plan Architecture

**Purpose:** use the Plan agent to turn spec + design into architecture, product type, frontend/backend/database boundaries, security model, tenancy model, scalability assumptions, and sprint briefs.

**Why it matters:** building without a plan causes agent drift. Day 5 is where the product becomes a system: secure enough, scalable enough, simple enough, and broken into buildable slices.

**What the learner learns:**

- what architecture means before code
- product type: web app, mobile-first responsive app, agent, or hybrid
- frontend/backend boundaries
- database and ownership boundaries
- auth model choices: public/anonymous, login required, invite-only, team roles, admin roles, or mixed access
- multi-tenancy decision: whether the product needs team/workspace/customer-account boundaries now or soon
- RBAC decision: whether roles like owner/admin/member/viewer are needed, or simple owner-only access is enough
- secure architecture: auth, authorization, secrets, RLS, AI permissions, rate limits, and cost limits
- single-user vs multi-tenant vs public/community data models
- scalability as a planning input without overbuilding
- compliance, privacy, reliability, observability, cost, integrations, and data import/export
- data model thinking
- API contracts
- sprint briefs as build contracts
- backend path optionality

**Backend path decision:**

```text
Default: Next.js + MUI + Supabase + Vercel
Optional: FastAPI + Supabase + a backend host such as Railway, Fly.io, Render, or another justified provider when there is a real backend reason
```

If unsure, choose Supabase-only. Use FastAPI only for complex backend logic, Python libraries, background jobs, enterprise API boundaries, heavy integrations, or long-running workflows. If FastAPI is chosen, the architecture must name the host, CORS rules, auth/session strategy, health check, env vars, tests, and deploy path.

**What the learner does:**

- decides product type
- chooses Supabase-only or FastAPI backend path
- chooses single-user, multi-tenant, or public/community tenancy
- chooses auth model and protected/public route boundaries
- decides whether RBAC is needed and defines roles if it is
- reviews security and permission boundaries
- reviews architecture decisions
- reviews data model and API boundaries
- approves sprint sequence

**What the harness does:**

- acts as the Plan agent
- reads PRD, refined PRD, design spec, and design system
- teaches architecture tradeoffs before generating artifacts
- explains the backend path tradeoff
- defaults to Supabase-only unless FastAPI is justified
- creates `.onemillion/architecture.md`
- creates `.onemillion/sprints/`
- runs Validate Plan thinking before build begins

**Done means:**

- `.onemillion/architecture.md` exists
- `.onemillion/sprints/` exists
- product type decision is recorded
- backend path decision is recorded
- tenancy model is recorded
- RBAC decision is recorded, even if the answer is "no RBAC for MVP"
- security model is recorded
- sprint briefs are self-contained build contracts
- validate-plan passes or findings are resolved

## Day 6: App Shell + First Deploy

**Purpose:** create the real app shell from the plan, apply the MUI baseline, push to GitHub, and deploy the frontend to Vercel.

**Why it matters:** the learner now moves from documents to working software, but with a spec, design, and plan behind it.

**What the learner learns:**

- Next.js project structure
- MUI setup
- GitHub product repo
- Vercel deploy loop
- how to verify live source matches local code

**What the learner does:**

- creates the product app
- applies app shell/navigation from design
- initializes product git repo if needed
- creates product GitHub repo
- deploys frontend to Vercel
- verifies push-to-deploy works

**Exact links:**

- GitHub new repo: https://github.com/new
- Vercel signup: https://vercel.com/signup
- Vercel import: https://vercel.com/new
- Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Vercel Git docs: https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git

**Done means:**

- product GitHub repo exists
- app runs locally
- Vercel deployment URL works
- live homepage matches local source markers

## Day 7: Auth + Database

**Purpose:** add Supabase Auth, session handling, protected routes, database tables, environment variables, and Row Level Security.

**Why it matters:** useful products remember users and protect their data. Auth is the module that answers who the user is; RLS is the database boundary that makes sure users and tenants cannot see each other's private rows.

**What the learner learns:**

- Supabase project setup
- why authentication matters for trust, privacy, personalization, billing, audit trails, and safe AI actions
- identity, session, authorization, and RLS
- RBAC: Role-Based Access Control, including owner/admin/member/viewer patterns
- single-tenant vs multi-tenant user hierarchy from the beginning
- auth method choices: email/password, magic link, OAuth, invite-only, admin-created users, or team roles
- Supabase Auth with Next.js
- callback routes, protected routes, login/logout/session state
- environment variables
- Postgres tables with ownership fields
- profile, organization, membership, and role table patterns
- how to keep user information secure
- second-user isolation testing

**What the learner does:**

- creates Supabase project
- stores env vars locally and in Vercel
- scaffolds signup/login/logout, callback, and session state
- protects private routes
- creates first tables from the architecture
- creates profile, organization, or membership tables when the architecture needs multi-user hierarchy
- enables RLS and tests cross-user protection

**Exact links:**

- Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Supabase project shortcut: https://database.new
- Supabase Next.js Auth: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/quickstarts/nextjs
- Supabase API keys: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/api-keys
- Supabase redirect URLs: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls
- Supabase RLS: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security
- Vercel env vars: https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables

**Done means:**

- Supabase project exists
- auth method is chosen and implemented
- single-tenant or multi-tenant model is chosen intentionally
- RBAC roles are defined when teams, organizations, or admin/member differences exist
- signup/login/logout work locally and live when signup is part of the product
- protected dashboard works
- RLS is enabled on private tables
- second-user isolation passes when private data exists
- secrets are not committed

## Day 8: Core Build

**Purpose:** complete one useful non-AI sprint from the sprint brief.

**Why it matters:** AI is not the product if the basic workflow does not work. Day 8 makes the app useful before adding AI by finishing one vertical slice end to end.

**What the learner learns:**

- what one useful sprint means
- vertical slice thinking
- sprint brief as build contract
- CRUD workflow in practice
- forms and validation
- UI connected to Supabase
- loading, empty, error, success, and permission states
- deployed functional QA
- cross-user data safety
- small commit discipline

**What the learner does:**

- chooses the next useful sprint from `.onemillion/sprints/`
- builds create/read/update/delete or archive for the core entity
- connects UI to Supabase
- handles basic user states
- tests locally
- deploys and tests live
- runs second-user RLS checks
- reviews one meaningful sprint commit

**Done means:**

- exactly one useful sprint is selected and completed
- core workflow works locally and live
- CRUD or archive works end to end
- data persists in Supabase
- loading, empty, error, and success states are handled
- protected routes still reject unauthenticated users
- second user cannot see first user's data when private data exists
- one meaningful sprint commit exists

## Day 9: Implementation Review

**Purpose:** use the Review agent and manual product inspection to compare the built app against the spec, design, target-user pain, and product intent before writing more tests or AI.

**Why it matters:** working code can still be the wrong code. Day 9 teaches spec drift detection, UI inspection, target-user empathy, and product sharpening before the learner keeps building.

**What the learner learns:**

- what code review means
- spec vs implementation
- manual product inspection
- how to inspect whether the UI looks like what the learner had in mind
- how to judge whether the flow feels simple and natural
- how to review from the target user's shoes
- how to assess whether the sprint alleviates the original pain point or unmet need
- blockers, bugs, edge cases, observations
- when to fix now vs defer

**What the learner does:**

- runs review against `.onemillion/refined-prd.md`
- opens the app and manually inspects the Day 8 workflow
- asks whether the UI, copy, fields, and flow speak to the target user
- reads `.onemillion/review-findings.md`
- fixes blockers or explicitly defers non-critical issues
- sharpens the product where the smallest change would improve usefulness
- keeps building after blockers are resolved

**Done means:**

- `.onemillion/review-findings.md` exists
- manual UI/product inspection is included
- target-user pain-point fit is assessed
- blockers are fixed or intentionally deferred with reason
- deferrals have a next sprint or reason
- app still builds
- Day 8 workflow still works locally or live

## Day 10: QA + Tests

**Purpose:** teach what good QA is and prove the core app works.

**Why it matters:** learners need to know the difference between “it opened once” and “it works.” Day 10 teaches happy paths, edge cases, negative cases, and live QA.

**What the learner learns:**

- what good QA means
- good QA mindset
- acceptance criteria as tests
- manual QA vs automated tests
- test plans and test cases
- frontend/component testing
- backend testing when a backend service exists
- API testing
- Playwright and Selenium-style E2E testing
- happy paths, edge cases, and permission checks
- auth, RLS, tenant, and RBAC checks
- evidence-based verification

**What the learner does:**

- writes or reviews `.onemillion/test-plan.md`
- maps acceptance criteria to test cases
- writes or reviews tests/manual QA checklist
- runs local checks
- tests the live Vercel URL
- records QA result

**Done means:**

- `.onemillion/test-plan.md` exists
- acceptance criteria are mapped to test cases
- `.onemillion/test-results.md` exists
- manual QA checklist is completed
- automated tests run where the repo supports them
- auth/RLS/tenant/RBAC checks are covered
- live app passes critical path QA
- failures are fixed or explicitly deferred with reason

## Day 11: AI Feature Spec

**Purpose:** define the AI feature by updating the existing refined PRD/spec before writing AI code.

**Why it matters:** “add AI” is not a feature. Day 11 turns AI into a measurable job with inputs, outputs, constraints, failure modes, and cost boundaries.

**What the learner learns:**

- what adding AI means: calling a large language model inside the app to do a specific job
- useful AI vs AI decoration
- simple AI feature vs agentic behavior
- where API keys come from: Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google
- how to store AI API keys securely
- prompt inputs and expected outputs
- structured output vs free text
- tool calling at a high level
- AI frameworks at a high level, and why to skip them for now unless needed
- structured output where useful
- measurable AI acceptance criteria
- failure modes, privacy, latency, and cost awareness

**What the learner does:**

- defines one useful AI job
- updates `.onemillion/refined-prd.md` with the AI feature section
- updates architecture or existing sprint notes only if the AI decision changes architecture, security boundaries, or build scope
- writes quality criteria
- records provider/model and API key handling plan
- records whether tool calling is needed
- documents failure modes and budget

**Done means:**

- refined PRD includes the selected AI feature
- provider/model and secret-storage plan are recorded
- tool-calling decision is recorded
- AI behavior is measurable
- failure modes and cost budget are recorded

## Day 12: First AI Build

**Purpose:** make the app call the selected LLM securely from server-side code.

**Why it matters:** the learner sees real AI output inside the product while keeping API keys server-side.

**What the learner learns:**

- server-side AI calls
- selected provider API key handling
- `.env.local`, `.env.example`, and Vercel env vars
- prompt construction
- safe product-data selection
- Next.js route handler or server action for AI
- local and live AI testing
- secret leak detection
- common AI error handling

**What the learner does:**

- creates selected provider API key
- stores provider key locally and in deployment env vars
- updates `.env.example` with placeholder only
- builds server route/action
- adds UI trigger
- tests output locally and live
- scans for key leaks

- Google AI Studio API keys: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Vercel env vars: https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables

**Done means:**

- AI route/action exists
- AI output appears in app
- selected provider key is stored locally and in Vercel
- `.env.example` has placeholders only
- local app AI path works
- live app AI path works
- API key is not exposed to client code
- common error states are handled

## Day 13: Product Polish + UX Finish

**Purpose:** make the product feel usable, clear, and credible before the final trust and QA gates.

**Why it matters:** a product can technically work and still feel confusing. Day 13 teaches the learner to inspect the app from the target user's point of view, improve the core flow, sharpen copy, finish missing states, and make the AI feature understandable instead of mysterious.

**What the learner learns:**

- product polish as friction removal
- empty, loading, error, success, and partial states
- copy, hierarchy, labels, and navigation
- mobile and desktop polish
- AI UX as part of the product flow
- review, retry, edit, and accept patterns for AI output

**What the learner does:**

- reviews the product like the target user
- improves the main MVP flow
- adds or sharpens missing UI states
- improves Day 12 AI waiting, output, retry, and review behavior
- fixes mobile/desktop layout issues
- updates existing refined PRD/spec only if intended behavior changes

**Done means:**

- the main MVP flow is understandable without explanation
- empty/loading/error/success states work where needed
- AI output has clear waiting, retry, and review behavior
- mobile and desktop layouts do not break
- target-user pain point still feels central

## Day 14: Security + Trust Review

**Purpose:** audit auth, authorization, tenancy, RBAC, RLS, secrets, AI privacy, and cost/abuse controls before final QA.

**Why it matters:** security is product quality. A real product must protect user identity, user data, tenant boundaries, server secrets, and AI context before it is treated as production-ready.

**What the learner learns:**

- authentication versus authorization
- owner-based access, tenancy, and RBAC
- Supabase RLS as a data protection layer
- server-only secrets and API keys
- AI data minimization and prompt injection basics
- rate, cost, and abuse controls
- why RAG/tool use stays optional unless justified

**What the learner does:**

- reviews protected routes and data access
- checks owner, tenant, or RBAC boundaries
- checks Supabase RLS assumptions
- scans for exposed secrets
- reviews AI route privacy and minimal context
- decides whether RAG/tool use is skipped or justified
- fixes critical trust blockers

**Done means:**

- auth and authorization behave correctly
- RLS protects user/tenant data where needed
- no server-only secret is exposed
- AI receives only allowed, minimal context
- RAG/tool use is skipped or justified
- critical trust blockers are fixed

## Day 15: QA + Production Readiness

**Purpose:** prove the product works, fix production blockers, and decide whether the app is ready for Day 16 shipping.

**Why it matters:** QA is evidence. The product is not ready because it looks done; it is ready when the main journey, auth/data behavior, AI behavior, live deployment, and known risks have been checked.

**What the learner learns:**

- final QA from acceptance criteria
- manual QA versus automated tests
- unit, component, API, backend, E2E, Playwright, and Selenium-style testing
- live deployment QA
- AI pass/fail examples
- production blocker classification

**What the learner does:**

- runs a final manual QA pass
- adds or runs the smallest useful automated tests
- verifies the live deployment critical path
- tests AI behavior with pass/fail examples
- fixes production-blocking bugs
- records accepted MVP risks in the existing verification trail

**Done means:**

- local build/test commands pass or failures are fixed/deferred with reason
- manual QA covers main journey, auth, data, AI, and error states
- live deployment critical path works
- AI pass/fail examples are acceptable
- no Day 14 critical blocker remains
- production blockers are fixed before Day 16

## Day 16: Ship Production

**Purpose:** turn the MVP into a production product people can visit, verify, monitor, and recover.

**Why it matters:** shipping means more than "Vercel says deployed." Local success does not prove production success. Day 16 checks production environment variables, Supabase auth redirects, RLS assumptions, optional backend hosting, live smoke tests, monitoring, custom domain optionality, and rollback before the learner starts selling.

**What the learner learns:**

- production versus preview deployments
- production environment variables
- Vercel production deployment
- Supabase Auth Site URL and redirect URLs
- Supabase RLS production checks
- optional FastAPI backend deployment only if architecture selected it
- live smoke tests
- monitoring, analytics, uptime, and logs
- custom domain and DNS optionality
- rollback and recovery

**What the learner does:**

- verifies Day 15 has no production blocker
- audits production env vars by name without exposing secret values
- deploys or verifies the Vercel production app
- confirms Supabase production auth/RLS settings
- deploys optional FastAPI backend only if architecture selected it
- runs smoke tests on the live URL
- configures or intentionally defers monitoring/analytics/uptime
- optionally connects a custom domain
- records rollback path
- updates `.onemillion/state.json` with `live_url`

**Done means:**

- production URL returns 200 and does not show an application error
- live app matches the current local/product source
- Vercel production env vars are set by name with no secret values committed
- Supabase auth/RLS production checks pass where applicable
- optional FastAPI backend is deployed and health-checked, or explicitly skipped
- live smoke test covers main flow, auth, data, and AI where applicable
- monitoring/analytics/uptime is configured or intentionally deferred
- custom domain works or skip is documented
- rollback path is known
- `.onemillion/state.json` includes `live_url`

## Day 17: Brand + Marketing + Pricing + First Users

**Purpose:** make the product understandable, credible, priced, and visible to first users.

**Why it matters:** a product without positioning is hard to share. Day 17 turns the live build into a clear offer, a benefit-first page, a simple pricing stance, launch content, and first-user outreach. The goal is not a huge launch; it is finding a small number of people who understand the pain and care enough to respond.

**What the learner learns:**

- brand for an early product
- positioning and category choice
- benefit-first landing/product page copy
- CTA design
- MVP pricing: free beta, waitlist, one-time, subscription, usage-based, or demo-call first
- launch content for LinkedIn, X, and communities
- outreach without spamming
- feedback capture and signal interpretation
- simple SEO foundations and launch metrics

**What the learner does:**

- creates a product name, tagline, and one-line promise
- writes the positioning statement
- updates the landing/product page or app copy
- chooses a pricing stance
- writes launch posts and cold outreach messages
- identifies 5-10 relevant people or communities
- sends or schedules at least 3 messages/posts
- records feedback or pending-response status honestly
- reflects learnings in product copy, PRD, or Builder Claim notes if direction changes

- product page has headline, pain, solution, proof/demo, CTA, pricing, and basic SEO metadata
- pricing stance is explicit
- outreach was sent or scheduled to real people or relevant communities
- feedback signal or pending-feedback status is recorded

## Day 18: Demo Day + Builder Claim

**Purpose:** package the build into a public demo and submit proof.

**Why it matters:** the course ends with a product, a demo, a proof packet, and a review path for Builder #N.

**What the learner learns:**

- demo storytelling
- final verification
- public proof
- Builder Claim submission

**What the learner does:**

- plans a 5-minute demo
- records Loom
- tests Loom public sharing
- prepares claim data from `.onemillion/state.json`, the live URL, and Loom URL
- runs final verification
- submits Builder Claim issue or form
- shares the win

## What The Harness Should Do At The Start Of Each Day

Use this order every time:

1. State the current day and title.
2. Explain how it fits the whole course arc.
3. Explain what the learner will learn today.
4. Explain what the learner will do today.
5. Provide exact links for any external service.
6. Provide exact commands or copy-ready prompts.
7. Ask for human decisions before making product choices.
8. End with the done checklist.
9. Tell the learner to say `day done` only when the checklist is true.

## What The Harness Should Never Do

Do not say:

```text
Do Day 1.
Do Day 2.
Run the verifier.
Go to Vercel.
Open Supabase.
Submit the form.
```

Instead, explain the day, provide links and copy-ready material, and define done.

## Recovery

If the learner returns after a break:

1. Read `.onemillion/state.json`.
2. Read the verification history inside `.onemillion/state.json`.
3. Inspect the current PRD/app state.
4. Summarize where they are.
5. Give the next smallest action.

Do not shame missed days. The 18 days are units of progress, not calendar days.
