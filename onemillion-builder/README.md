You've seen the posts. Solo founders shipping SaaS in a weekend. Indie builders launching real AI products from their laptops. People who had never written code running real businesses. You follow along. Three hours in, you're debugging a system you don't understand, wondering if this is actually for you.

**It is. And this is how.**

- **Mandatory first move: star, fork, clone.** Your fork becomes your public learning workspace and proof trail.
- **18 days, one product at a time.** No information overload. You make one meaningful move each day and understand it before moving on.
- **1–2 hours per day.** Short enough to fit around work, family, and the rest of real life.
- **A deployed product, not a sandbox.** By the end, you have a live URL, working AI features, documented feedback from at least one real person, and a launch plan.
- **Use AI to learn how to build with AI.** The course is designed around portable OneMillion agents that help you ideate, spec, design, plan, build, test, guard, ship, and sell.
- **Free forever.** Course content is MIT licensed. No bootcamp fee. No paywalled advanced tier.

## ✨ What Is OneMillion Builders?

**OneMillion is on a mission to take one million people — anyone with an idea — from zero to a real, deployed, launchable product in 18 days.**

Not a tutorial. Not a sandbox. A real product, on a real server, ready for real users.

We do this through an **agent-readable course repo**. Open it in Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, Copilot, or another coding harness. The harness reads `AGENTS.md` and `course-manifest.json`, becomes your OneMillion learning orchestrator, and guides one focused agent at a time:

```text
/idea → /spec → /design → /plan → /build → /test → /guard → /ship → /sell
```

Utility modes are always available:

```text
/ask · /debug · /refactor · /orchestrator
```

**No prior coding knowledge required.** The agents guide you through every decision. If you've never written a line of code, the path is built for you. If you're an engineer, you blaze through and go deeper.

By the end, you have a live URL, working AI features, documented feedback from at least one real person, and a launch plan. No OneMillion login is required for the local course flow. Optional product infrastructure costs, like domains, are covered in the Day 14 guide.

## ⭐ Mandatory First Steps

Before Day 1, every learner does this:

1. **Star** this repo so you can find it again and help the next builder discover it.
2. **Fork** this repo into your own GitHub account.
3. **Clone your fork**, not Sid's original repo.
4. Run the installer so the repo can verify/fix `origin` and `upstream`.
5. Open your fork in your favorite coding harness.
6. Paste the start prompt below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/teach-one-million.git
cd teach-one-million
./onemillion-builder/install-agents.sh
```

If the GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated, the installer stars the upstream repo, creates or verifies your fork, sets `origin` to your fork, sets `upstream` to Sid's repo, and starts local course state. If it cannot verify the clone/fork/upstream setup, it stops before the course begins.

Then tell your coding harness:

```text
I am starting the OneMillion course from my fork.

Read AGENTS.md and onemillion-builder/course-manifest.json.
Become my OneMillion learning orchestrator.
First enforce the Preflight Gate. If anything is wrong with clone/fork/origin/upstream setup, stop and fix it before Day 0.
Then start Day 0 and Day 1.
Teach me one day at a time.
When I say "day done", verify the day and advance me.
Do not skip the learning or do the external tool steps for me.
```

This course page is the canonical learner landing page:

```text
https://github.com/siddsdixit/teach-one-million/tree/main/onemillion-builder
```

When any day asks for an external account, key, dashboard permission, or public link, use [Account Setup Playbook](account-setup.md). It gives the exact link, exact permission, and QA check for GitHub, Vercel, Supabase, Anthropic, Sentry, UptimeRobot, and Loom.

## 🗺️ Course Map

| Stage | Days | Outcome | Start |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| 🧱 **Foundation** | 1-6 | Deployed web app with auth, database, and one core feature | [Week 1](week-1-foundation/README.md) |
| 🧠 **Make It AI** | 7-12 | Real Claude-powered feature with streaming, tools, RAG, and quality gates | [Week 2](week-2-make-it-ai/README.md) |
| 🚢 **Ship & Sell** | 13-18 | Production hygiene, landing page, outreach, demo, and Builder Claim | [Week 3](week-3-ship-and-sell/README.md) |

Each day has the same rhythm: **learn → build → verify → update progress**.

---

## 🎓 Get Certified — Become a Builder

Complete all 18 days, pass final verification, and submit your Builder Claim. Once accepted, you earn **Builder #N**: sequential, permanent, public, and listed forever at [onemillion.build/builders](../builders/README.md).

Each day has an AI verification prompt. Day 18 requires your daily verification reports, a public repo, a deployed URL, a Loom demo, and final anti-cheating checks. See [How Builder #N is earned](verify/README.md).

![Sample Builder profile](diagrams/builder-profile-sample.png)

First 100 builders ever get **Founding Builder** status: permanent badge + Sid's personal Slack + intro to one investor or hiring manager on graduation.

Apply for the next cohort: [cohort/README.md](../cohort/README.md)

## 💡 How It Works

You don't need to know how to code. If you do — great, you'll go faster. Either way, you finish.

Here's the journey: over 18 days, you become a **lean, AI-powered builder** — someone who can take an idea from a napkin concept to a production-shaped product deployed on the cloud. Not a toy tutorial. A working application — an AI agent, a web app, or a hybrid of both — that is ready for first users and real feedback.

You can do OneMillion two ways:

- 🧑‍💻 **Self-paced.** Follow the 18 days in this repo on your own schedule.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Live cohort.** Join a free group when applications are open.

The same curriculum and verifiers apply either way.

**Every day follows the same rhythm:**

- 📖 **Learn.** Read a short concept that builds your mental model.
- 🛠️ **Build.** Follow a hands-on guide where your coding harness does the heavy lifting. You direct. You review. You ship.
- ✅ **Verify.** Say `day done`. Your harness checks the day's completion gate and tells you what passed, what failed, and what to fix.

**Support is built in:**

- 🎥 **Video walkthroughs** — Sid walks through the course so you have a human reference
- 🗓️ **Weekly live sessions** — group calls to unblock, answer questions, and keep you moving
- 💬 **Slack community** — a dedicated channel where builders help each other in real time
- 🧑‍🏫 **Mentors on call** — real people who've been through the build, ready to answer when you're stuck

The only thing you need to bring is the will to keep going. If you show up, we show up: walkthroughs, community support, office hours, and mentors are designed to keep you moving when you get stuck.

**What you need to start:**

- 💻 A laptop (Mac or Windows)
- 🧩 A coding harness that can read files and edit a workspace
- 🔑 GitHub, Supabase, and Vercel accounts for the app you ship
- ⏱️ 1–2 hours a day

**What you keep forever:**

When you graduate, the AI agents you built with don't go away. They stay in your toolkit — ready to help you spec, design, build, test, secure, deploy, and sell the next product. And the one after that. **You've learned how to wield AI. That skill compounds for life.**
