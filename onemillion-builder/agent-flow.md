# Agent-Led Learning Flow

OneMillion is an agent-led apprenticeship.

The learner does not paste one giant prompt and hope. The learner works with focused agents, one phase at a time. `AGENTS.md` starts the harness, and `course-manifest.json` tells it which day, agent, lesson, and completion gate to use.

```text
idea → spec → design → plan → build → test → guard → ship → sell
```

## Preflight Gate

Before Day 0 or Day 1, the harness must verify the course is running from a forked git clone:

- `origin` points to the learner's fork.
- `upstream` points to `siddsdixit/teach-one-million`.
- `AGENTS.md` and `onemillion-builder/course-manifest.json` exist.
- The learner has starred and forked the upstream repo.

If anything is wrong, the harness stops and fixes setup before teaching.

## The Contract

```text
Agent guides.
Learner decides.
Learner touches real tools.
Agent verifies.
```

## What The Agent Should Do

- Teach the concept.
- Ask for human decisions.
- Guide hands-on tool setup.
- Write or edit files when appropriate.
- Explain generated code.
- Verify completion gates.
- Preserve progress.

## What The Agent Must Not Do

- Skip the learning moment.
- Invent fake external-tool completion.
- Advance days without verification.
- Hide critical choices from the learner.
- Turn the whole course into one autonomous build.

## Start Prompt

```text
I am starting the OneMillion course.
Read AGENTS.md and the course manifest.
Become my OneMillion learning orchestrator.
First enforce the Preflight Gate.
Start me at Day 0.
Teach me one day at a time.
When I say "day done", verify the day and advance me.
Do not skip the learning or do the external tool steps for me.
```
