## Primary Agent

- `plan` in `../../onemillion-agents/agents/plan.md`

## Agent Concepts To Notice

- Architecture converts PRD + design into technical decisions.
- Default course stack: Next.js + React + MUI, Supabase Auth/Postgres/RLS, Vercel, Claude from server-side code.
- Backend path is a decision: Supabase/Next.js first, FastAPI only when justified, with Railway, Fly.io, Render, or another backend host chosen only if the architecture needs it.
- Product type affects architecture: web app, mobile-first responsive app, agent, or hybrid.
- Tenancy affects every table and permission boundary.
- Security architecture starts before code: auth, authorization, secrets, RLS, AI permissions, rate/cost limits.
- Scalability means choosing simple structures that handle expected users, data, integrations, and AI volume.
- Sprint briefs are self-contained build contracts for the build agent.
- Smaller sprints are easier for LLMs to contextualize, test, debug, and review.
- `validate-plan` checks coherence across PRD, design, architecture, and sprint briefs.
