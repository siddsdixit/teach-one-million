## Before You Start

- [ ] Previous day is verified in `.onemillion/state.json`.
- [ ] You are in the correct product/course workspace.
- [ ] You have read [learn.md](./learn.md).

## Step 1: Ask The Harness To Teach The Day

Paste this:

```text
I am on OneMillion Day 7: Auth + Database.

Act as the `build` agent for this day.
First teach me the concept in plain language.
Then guide me one step at a time.
Use the course manifest, single.md, and the current pipeline artifacts.
Do not skip my human decisions.
Do not create paperwork-only files.
When an external provider is needed, give the exact full URL and QA check.
```

## Step 2: Make The Human Decisions

Before the harness writes or changes anything, answer these decisions:

- auth provider choices
- table shape
- RLS policy intent
- redirect URLs

## Step 3: Produce The Day Output

Expected output today:

- Supabase auth
- RLS-protected tables

Work with the harness until the output matches the day's purpose. Review generated artifacts before accepting them.

## Step 4: External Tools

- Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Supabase project shortcut: https://database.new
- Supabase Next.js Auth: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/quickstarts/nextjs
- Supabase API keys: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/api-keys
- Supabase redirect URLs: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls
- Supabase RLS: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security
- Vercel signup: https://vercel.com/signup
- Vercel import: https://vercel.com/new
- Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Vercel Git docs: https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git
- Vercel env vars: https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables
- Vercel domains docs: https://vercel.com/docs/domains
- Vercel Analytics: https://vercel.com/docs/analytics

If the harness mentions an external provider, it must also give the exact link, permission/settings, and QA check from `onemillion-builder/docs/account-setup.md`.

## Step 5: Verify

Ask your harness:

```text
Run the OneMillion verifier for Day 7.
Inspect the relevant artifacts, app code, deployment links, and manual confirmations.
Record the result in .onemillion/state.json.
Do not create separate verifier markdown files.
```

## Update Orchestrator State

Before you close today, ask the orchestrator to update `.onemillion/state.json`:

- **Current day:** Day 7 complete
- **Last verified day:** Day 7
- **Current blocker:** None, or the exact blocker to resume from
- **Next smallest action:** Open Day 8.

## What Should Be True After Day 7

- [ ] Supabase project exists
- [ ] signup works locally and live
- [ ] login/logout works
- [ ] RLS enabled
- [ ] env vars are not leaked

## If You Are Stuck

Paste this into your harness:

```text
I am on OneMillion Day 7: Auth + Database.
I am stuck on this part:
[paste the step or artifact]

Here is what I expected:
[describe]

Here is what happened:
[describe]

Help me find the smallest next action. Teach the concept if I am missing it. Do not skip the learning moment.
```
