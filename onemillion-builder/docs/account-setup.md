# Account Setup Playbook

Use this page whenever a day asks you to create an account, connect a service, create a key, set permissions, or verify a dashboard setting.

The rule is simple:

```text
Open the exact link. Do the smallest setup. Verify it immediately. Save only the non-secret proof.
```

Never paste secrets into chat, screenshots, GitHub, Slack, Loom, or committed files.

This playbook supports the `AGENTS.md` Preflight Gate and `course-manifest.json` provider setup links.
