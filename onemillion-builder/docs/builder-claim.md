## Reviewer Notes

[Anything the reviewer should know.]
```

## Reviewer QA

The reviewer should check:

- Course fork exists and has Day 0 setup evidence.
- Product live URL opens in an incognito browser.
- Loom opens without login.
- Loom shows the live product, not slides only.
- Demo behavior matches the product claim.
- Verification reports exist for all required days.
- Deployment evidence matches local code where automated checks support it.
- Duplicate submissions are not using the same product URL/Loom/repo without explanation.

Accepted claim = official Builder #N.
