# Getting Started

OneMillion runs inside your coding harness.

You can use:

- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Codex
- Gemini
- Antigravity
- GitHub Copilot / VS Code
- another agentic coding tool that can read files and edit a workspace

The course repo contains the instructions, agents, manifest, examples, and daily lessons. Your harness becomes the teacher by reading them.

When a step asks for an external account, API key, dashboard setting, permission, or public link, open [Account Setup Playbook](account-setup.md). It gives the exact provider link and the QA check for that setup.

Start from the rendered course page:

```text
https://github.com/siddsdixit/teach-one-million/tree/main/onemillion-builder
```

---

## Mandatory GitHub Preflight

You must do these before Day 0 or Day 1:

1. Star `siddsdixit/teach-one-million`.
2. Fork `siddsdixit/teach-one-million`.
3. Clone your fork.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/teach-one-million.git
cd teach-one-million
./onemillion-builder/install-agents.sh
```

Open your fork in your coding harness. If the repo is a downloaded zip, a loose folder, or Sid's upstream clone, the harness should stop and fix the setup before teaching.

---

## The First Prompt

Paste this into your harness:

```text
I am starting the OneMillion course from my fork.

Course page:
https://github.com/siddsdixit/teach-one-million/tree/main/onemillion-builder

Read AGENTS.md and onemillion-builder/course-manifest.json.
Become my OneMillion learning orchestrator.
First enforce the Preflight Gate. If anything is wrong with clone/fork/origin/upstream setup, stop and fix it before Day 0.
Then start Day 0 and Day 1.
Teach me one day at a time.
When I say "day done", verify the day and advance me.
Do not skip the learning or do the external tool steps for me.
```

---

## Optional Native Adapter Install

From inside the cloned repo:

```bash
./onemillion-builder/install-agents.sh
```

If GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated, the installer stars the upstream repo, creates or verifies your fork, sets `origin` to your fork, sets `upstream` to Sid's repo, and starts local course state. It also installs local adapter files:

```text
.claude/agents/
.claude/commands/
.cursor/rules/
.agents/rules/
.gemini/GEMINI.md
.github/copilot-instructions.md
```

The universal source remains:

```text
AGENTS.md
onemillion-builder/course-manifest.json
onemillion-agents/
```

## What You Still Learn Hands-On

The harness does not replace the work.

You will still learn and touch:

- GitHub for source control
- Vercel for deployment
- Supabase for auth, database, and Row Level Security
- AI API/server routes for your product feature
- monitoring tools
- Loom for Demo Day
- outreach and user feedback

The agent teaches and guides. You make decisions and do the real external-tool steps.
