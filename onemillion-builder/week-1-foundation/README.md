# Week 1 — Foundation

**Outcome by end of Week 1:** A real web app deployed at your own URL with working signup/login and your core feature live.

No AI yet. That's Week 2. Week 1 is about getting the bones in place — auth, database, deployment, and one feature working end to end. Once these are solid, adding AI is fast.

## The Five Pillars Show Up Here

| Pillar | Where this week |
|--------|----------------|
| **Spec before code** | Days 1–3 (you build nothing until your spec is locked) |
| **Multi-agent decomposition** | Day 6 (the Data → API → UI pattern is three separate agent calls) |
| **Validation gates** | End of every day (the "What Should Be True" checklist + the AI verifier) |
| **Production hygiene from day 1** | Day 5 (RLS on every table, secrets in `.env` not git) |
| **Human review loop** | Every day's "What to spot-check" section |

## What You Need Before Starting

- ✅ Local dev environment installed ([getting-started.md](../getting-started.md))
- ✅ Anthropic API key ([getting-your-api-key.md](../getting-your-api-key.md))
- ✅ GitHub, Supabase, Vercel accounts (signed up, no setup yet)
- ✅ ~10 hours of total time over the next 6 days

## What If Week 1 Takes Longer Than 6 Calendar Days?

Fine. Milestone-based, not calendar-based. Day 4 (stack setup) is the longest day for non-engineers — give it a weekend if you need it. The verification system only cares that each day's "What Should Be True" checklist passes. It doesn't care when.

Most builders finish Week 1 in 6–10 days. Engineers finish in 4–6 days.

## When You're Done With Week 1

You should have:
- A live URL where strangers can sign up and use your app
- A GitHub repo with 6+ commits, one per day minimum
- A core feature that works end-to-end (create, read, update, delete on your main entity)
- Row Level Security enabled on your database
- A locked PRD that hasn't been changed since Day 3

Then you move on to **Week 2: Make It AI** — adding real AI features to the app you just built.
