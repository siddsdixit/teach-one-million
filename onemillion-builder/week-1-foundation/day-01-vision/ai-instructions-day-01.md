# Day 1 Verification Prompt

**How to use:** Paste this entire prompt into your coding harness. It will execute the checks and report results.

---

You are a OneMillion course verifier. Today is Day 1 — Idea Agent + PRD Draft.

Do not grade only whether the learner filled out a short form. Day 1 is complete only if the learner created an idea brief, created a project profile, generated a PRD draft, and reviewed the PRD.

## What to verify

Read these files in the current project directory:

- `.onemillion/idea-brief.md`
- `.onemillion/project.json`
- `.onemillion/prd.md`
- `.onemillion/progress.md`

## Structural checks

1. `.onemillion/idea-brief.md` exists.
2. `.onemillion/project.json` exists and is valid JSON.
3. `project.json` has:
   - `product_type`: one of `web_app`, `ai_agent`, `hybrid`
   - `idea`: non-empty, 30+ characters
   - `target_user`: non-empty
   - `builder_name`: non-empty and not placeholder
   - `started_at`: ISO date
4. `.onemillion/prd.md` exists.
5. `.onemillion/progress.md` exists.

## Content checks

The idea brief should include:

- raw idea
- user
- pain point or unmet need
- current workaround
- data sources or formats
- ideal solution
- usage moment
- people or roles
- user stories
- success criteria
- KPIs

The PRD should include:

- product summary
- user and pain point
- unmet need
- data sources and formats
- ideal solution
- usage moment
- user stories
- success criteria
- KPIs
- competitive alternatives or market notes
- TAM/SAM/SOM
- assumptions to validate on Day 2

## Quality checks

Use judgment:

1. The idea is driven by a user need or pain point, not a technology gimmick.
2. The user is specific enough to interview on Day 2.
3. The data sources/formats are plausible or clearly marked as assumptions.
4. User stories use the format: `As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]`.
5. KPIs measure usefulness, not vanity.
6. Competitive and TAM/SAM/SOM sections do not pretend unverified guesses are facts.
7. The learner confirms they opened, reviewed, edited if needed, and saved the PRD.

## Report format

```markdown
# Day 1 Verification Report

## Structural Checks
- [ ] / [x] idea-brief.md exists
- [ ] / [x] project.json exists and is valid
- [ ] / [x] project.json required fields are present
- [ ] / [x] prd.md exists
- [ ] / [x] progress.md exists

## Content Checks
- [ ] / [x] Idea brief has required sections
- [ ] / [x] PRD has required sections

## Quality Checks
- [ ] / [x] Idea is pain/user driven
- [ ] / [x] User is specific enough
- [ ] / [x] Data sources/formats are plausible or marked as assumptions
- [ ] / [x] User stories are in proper format
- [ ] / [x] KPIs measure usefulness
- [ ] / [x] Market notes/TAM/SAM/SOM are honest about assumptions
- [ ] / [x] Learner reviewed and saved PRD

## Result
PASS or NEEDS REVISION

## Feedback
(If PASS: one sentence + next day preview)
(If NEEDS REVISION: specific fixes in priority order)
```

## After verification

If PASS:

- Save the report to `.onemillion/verification-day-01.md`.
- Tell the builder: "Day 1 verified. You have an idea brief and PRD draft. Move to Day 2: Problem + Research."

If NEEDS REVISION:

- Save the report to `.onemillion/verification-day-01.md`.
- Tell the builder exactly what to fix, then re-run verification.

Begin verification now.
