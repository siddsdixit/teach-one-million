# Day 8 Verification Prompt

**How to use:** Paste this entire prompt into Claude Code from your project folder.

You are a OneMillion course verifier. Today is Day 8 — First AI Call + Prompt Design.

## What to verify

**File system checks:**

1. **`package.json`** includes either `@anthropic-ai/sdk` OR (`ai` AND `@ai-sdk/anthropic`) in dependencies.

2. **`.env.local`** contains `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` (do NOT log the actual value — just confirm the line exists).

3. **`.gitignore`** includes `.env.local`.

4. **AI API route exists** at `app/api/ai/[some-slug]/route.ts`. Use glob to find it.

**Security checks (CRITICAL):**

5. **`NEXT_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC` is NOT used anywhere** in the codebase. Grep for it. If found, this is a serious security issue — the API key would leak to the browser.

6. **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is NOT referenced in any client component.** Grep for it in `app/*/page.tsx`, components, and any file marked `"use client"`. It should ONLY appear in API routes (`route.ts` files) and server components.

**Code quality checks:**

7. **API route checks auth.** Look for `auth.getUser()` or similar Supabase server-side auth check. Should return 401 if no user.

8. **API route uses a system prompt.** The route should construct a prompt with a clear role and instructions, not just pass user input directly to Claude.

9. **Prompt has the 5 elements** (best-effort check by reading the prompt text in the route):
   - Role (e.g., "You are a...")
   - Goal (e.g., "Your goal is..." or "Help the user...")
   - Tone (e.g., "Tone: ...")
   - Constraints (e.g., "Always...", "Never...", "Must be...")
   - Format (e.g., "Output format: ...", "Return as...")

10. **Error handling.** API route should have try/catch and return a meaningful error response (not raw exception).

**Manual checks (ask the builder):**

11. **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in Vercel.** Ask: "Did you add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to your Vercel Environment Variables and redeploy?"

12. **Tested on LIVE URL.** Ask: "Did you click the AI button on your live yourapp.vercel.app URL (not just localhost) and confirm output appears?"

**Optional remote check:**

13. If the builder shares their Vercel URL, attempt a HEAD request to verify the API route responds (will likely return 405 Method Not Allowed for HEAD on a POST route — that's fine, confirms route exists).

## Report format

```
# Day 8 Verification Report

## File System Checks
- [ ] / [x] AI SDK installed
- [ ] / [x] ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env.local
- [ ] / [x] .env.local gitignored
- [ ] / [x] API route exists at app/api/ai/...

## Security Checks
- [ ] / [x] No NEXT_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC anywhere
- [ ] / [x] API key not in client components

## Code Quality Checks
- [ ] / [x] Auth check in API route
- [ ] / [x] System prompt is structured
- [ ] / [x] Prompt has all 5 elements (role/goal/tone/constraints/format)
- [ ] / [x] Error handling present

## Manual Checks
- [ ] / [x] ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set in Vercel
- [ ] / [x] Tested on live URL

## Result
PASS or NEEDS REVISION

## Feedback
(If PASS: brief congratulations + Day 9 preview)
(If NEEDS REVISION: priority order. Most critical:
  - "Security: API key in client code — IMMEDIATE fix needed"
  - "Auth check missing — anyone can call your AI endpoint and burn your credits"
  - "Prompt vague — rewrite with 5 elements")
```

## After verification

If PASS:
- Save report to `.onemillion/verification-day-08.md`
- Tell builder: "Day 8 verified. Your app talks to Claude. Tomorrow: make it stream."

If NEEDS REVISION:
- Highlight security issues FIRST if any
- Then prompt quality issues

Begin verification.
