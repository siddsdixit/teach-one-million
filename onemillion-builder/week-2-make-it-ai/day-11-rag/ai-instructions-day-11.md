# Day 11 Verification Prompt

**How to use:** Paste this entire prompt into Claude Code from your project folder.

---

You are a OneMillion course verifier. Today is Day 11 — RAG.

## What to verify

**Code structure checks:**

1. **API route does retrieval BEFORE the AI call.** Look for `.from('table').select(...)` or similar Supabase queries that happen before `streamText` or `generateText`.

2. **Retrieval uses server-side Supabase client.** Should be `createClient()` from a server utility (`lib/supabase/server.ts`), NOT the service_role client.

3. **Retrieved data is converted to text/prose.** Look for a `context` variable or similar that's built from the fetched data using template strings, not `JSON.stringify`.

4. **Context is injected into the prompt.** The system prompt should reference the context (e.g., includes the `context` variable string).

5. **System prompt instructs AI to use ONLY context** (not invent). Look for phrases like "use only the information provided", "if you need info not in context, ask the user", etc.

6. **No-results handling exists.** If retrieval returns empty, the code should not call AI with empty context — should either return early with a helpful response or pass a "no data found" prompt.

**Cross-check:**

7. **Auth check still in place** (from Day 8) — `auth.getUser()` happens before retrieval.

**Manual checks (ask the builder):**

8. **AI output actually uses user data.** Ask: "When you ran your AI button, did the output reference your specific entity names, dates, statuses (instead of generic placeholders)?"

9. **🚨 CROSS-USER RAG TEST.** Ask: "Did you sign in as User B (incognito), trigger your AI feature, and confirm User B's output did NOT include any of User A's data?"

   - If yes ✅ → great
   - If not tested → STRONGLY encourage them to test now
   - If User B saw User A's data → ❌ CRITICAL — retrieval doesn't filter by user

10. **Cost stayed reasonable.** Ask: "Did adding RAG significantly increase your per-call cost? If yes, are you fetching too much context?" (Optional check, but flag if cost spiked >3x.)

11. **Tested on live URL.**

## Report format

```
# Day 11 Verification Report

## Code Structure
- [ ] / [x] Retrieval before AI call
- [ ] / [x] Server-side Supabase client (not service_role)
- [ ] / [x] Context converted to prose
- [ ] / [x] Context injected in prompt
- [ ] / [x] AI instructed to use only context
- [ ] / [x] No-results case handled
- [ ] / [x] Auth check intact

## Manual Checks
- [ ] / [x] AI output uses user-specific data visibly
- [ ] / [x] Cross-user test passed (User B sees no User A data)
- [ ] / [x] Cost reasonable
- [ ] / [x] Tested live

## Result
PASS or NEEDS REVISION

## Feedback
(If PASS: brief congrats + Day 12 preview)
(If NEEDS REVISION: priority. Most critical:
  - "Using service_role client — cross-user data leak risk"
  - "Cross-user test not run"
  - "AI invents data — system prompt needs explicit 'only use context' instruction")
```

## After verification

If PASS:
- Save report to `.onemillion/verification-day-11.md`
- Tell builder: "Day 11 verified. AI uses YOUR user's actual data. Tomorrow: lock the feature."

If NEEDS REVISION:
- Highlight security issues first if any

Begin verification.
