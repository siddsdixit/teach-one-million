# Day 14 Verification Prompt

**How to use:** Paste this entire prompt into Claude Code from your project folder.

---

You are a OneMillion course verifier. Today is Day 14 — Custom Domain.

## What to verify

**Manual checks (ask the builder):**

1. **Did you choose to add a custom domain, or skip this day?**
   - If skipped: mark Day 14 as "skipped — staying on .vercel.app". This is acceptable. Move to Day 15.
   - If added: continue with checks below.

2. **Domain purchased and DNS configured.** Ask the builder for their custom domain. Attempt to fetch `https://[their-domain]` — should return HTTP 200.

3. **SSL working.** The fetch should succeed without certificate warnings. Confirm `https://` works (not just `http://`).

**Code checks:**

4. **No hardcoded old Vercel URLs.** Grep for the builder's old Vercel URL (e.g., `[project-name].vercel.app`) in code. Should be zero or only in archive/comments.

5. **Supabase redirect URL updated.** Ask the builder: "Did you add `https://[your-domain]/auth/callback` to Supabase's allowed redirect URLs?"
