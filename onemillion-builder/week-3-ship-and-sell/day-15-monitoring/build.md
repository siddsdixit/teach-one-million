# Day 15 — Build Guide

**Time: 30-60 min. Three services, ~15-20 min each.**

---

## Step 1: Sentry (15-20 min)

1. Sign up at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Free plan.
2. Create new project → Platform: Next.js
3. Sentry shows you a **DSN** (looks like `https://xxx@xxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxx`). Copy.

In your terminal:
```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

The wizard installs the SDK + creates config files + asks for your DSN. Paste it.

It modifies your `next.config.js` and creates `sentry.client.config.js` + `sentry.server.config.js` + `sentry.edge.config.js`.

Add the env vars to Vercel:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` (your DSN)
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (the wizard provides this)

Test it:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Day 15: Sentry" && git push
```

After Vercel redeploys, trigger a test error. Easiest: add this line temporarily to a server component:
```typescript
throw new Error('Sentry test error — Day 15');
```

Push, visit that page on your live URL. The error should fire. Check Sentry dashboard within 60 sec — the error should appear.

Then revert the test error.

## Step 2: Vercel Analytics (5 min)

1. vercel.com → your project → **Analytics** tab → enable
2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   npm install @vercel/analytics
   ```
3. Add to `app/layout.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';
   // ... inside <body>
   <Analytics />
   ```
4. Commit + push.

After your next visit (and ~10 min of data accumulation), Vercel dashboard shows visitor counts.

## Step 3: UptimeRobot (10 min)

1. Sign up at [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com). Free plan.
2. Dashboard → **+ New Monitor**
3. Type: HTTP(s)
4. Friendly name: "OneMillion build — [your-app-name]"
5. URL: `https://yourapp.com` (or your .vercel.app URL)
6. Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes (free tier minimum)
7. **Save Changes**

8. **Settings** → **My Settings** → **Alert Contacts**
9. Add your email (probably already there from signup)
10. Make sure the new monitor uses this alert contact.

Test it: temporarily change your monitor URL to a domain that doesn't exist (`https://broken123.example`). Wait 5-10 min. You should get an email saying it's down.

Restore to your real URL.

## Step 4: Verify

```bash
claude
```

Paste contents of [`ai-instructions-day-15.md`](./ai-instructions-day-15.md).

## What Should Be True After Day 15

- [ ] `@sentry/nextjs` in package.json
- [ ] Sentry config files exist (client, server, edge)
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` in `.env.local` AND Vercel
- [ ] Sentry test error appeared in dashboard
- [ ] `@vercel/analytics` in package.json
- [ ] `<Analytics />` component in app/layout.tsx
- [ ] UptimeRobot monitoring your live URL
- [ ] Confirmed email alerts work
- [ ] Verification passed ✅

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Sentry test error doesn't appear | DSN wrong OR error doesn't actually fire OR ad blocker blocking Sentry. Check Sentry dashboard "Configure SDK". |
| Vercel Analytics shows no data | Wait 10-15 min. Also confirm `<Analytics />` is inside `<body>`. |
| UptimeRobot can't reach my site | Some CDNs block their IPs. Add UptimeRobot IPs to allowed list (Cloudflare). |
| Too many Sentry events | Add `beforeSend` filter to ignore non-critical errors (bots, transient). |
| Sentry SDK breaking build | Wizard may have created bad config. Re-run wizard OR ask Claude to fix `sentry.*.config.js` files. |
