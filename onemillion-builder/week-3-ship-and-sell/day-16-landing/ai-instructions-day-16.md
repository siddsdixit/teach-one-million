# Day 16 Verification Prompt

**How to use:** Paste this entire prompt into Claude Code from your project folder.

---

You are a OneMillion course verifier. Today is Day 16 — Landing Page.

## What to verify

**File system checks:**

1. **`app/page.tsx` exists** and is NOT the default Next.js boilerplate.

2. **Landing page contains all 5 sections.** Read the file. Look for content corresponding to:
   - Hero (headline + subhead + CTA button)
   - Problem section (text describing user pain)
   - Solution section (3 outcome bullets/cards)
   - Proof section (quote, screenshot reference, or "launching soon" message)
   - Second CTA at bottom

3. **Single primary CTA.** Should be the same button/text in Hero and at bottom. Not multiple competing CTAs.

4. **Auth redirect logic exists.** Look for `redirect('/dashboard')` or equivalent when user is logged in.

**Manual checks (ask the builder):**

5. **Live URL loads landing.** Ask for the live URL. Fetch it (incognito-style — without auth). Confirm:
   - HTTP 200
   - Page renders (not redirect loop, not error)

6. **Headline is specific.** Ask the builder for their headline. Verify it's:
   - Specific to a user / outcome (not "AI for productivity")
   - Under 80 characters
   - Not generic startup-speak

7. **Mobile-friendly.** Ask: "Did you test on phone? Does it look reasonable?"

8. **CTA works end-to-end.** Ask: "Did you click your CTA and confirm it leads to signup? After signing up, are you redirected to your dashboard?"

  - "Multiple CTAs competing — pick one, demote the rest"
  - "No mobile testing done — open on phone now")
```

## After verification

If PASS:
- Save report to `.onemillion/verification-day-16.md`
