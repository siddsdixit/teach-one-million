**Time: 30-60 min. Record demo. Submit for Builder #N review.**

---

## Before You Start

- [ ] Day 17 verified
- [ ] Live app URL works in an incognito browser
- [ ] Opened [Account Setup Playbook: Day 18](../../docs/account-setup.md#day-18-loom--builder-claim)

---

## Step 1: Plan The Demo (10 min)

Ask the orchestrator to record this demo plan in `.onemillion/state.json`:

```markdown
## Demo Plan (5 min total)

### Minute 1: Problem
- Open with: [one-sentence problem statement]
- Reference: Sarah, freelance UX designer, spends 90 min every Sunday on...

### Minute 2: Solution
- One sentence: [product name] does [outcome] in [time].

### Minutes 3-5: Live demo path
1. Open live URL: yourapp.com (12 sec)
2. Sign up as fresh user: test-day18@example.com (30 sec)
3. Land on dashboard, show empty state (10 sec)
4. Create first [entity]: name, status, due date (30 sec)
5. Trigger AI feature on it (30 sec)
6. Show AI response streaming (50 sec)
7. Save / use the output (20 sec)

### Last 30 sec: Wrap
- "Built this in 18 days through OneMillion. Submitting for Builder #N."
- One ask: [early users / feedback / hiring]
```

Don't memorize. Have it open in a second monitor as you record.

---

## Step 2: Pre-Flight Checks (5 min)

Before hitting record:

- [ ] Close all other browser tabs
- [ ] Clear cookies on your live URL (so you start logged out)
- [ ] Have a fresh email ready for the demo signup
- [ ] Camera + mic test
- [ ] Quiet environment (turn off notifications)
- [ ] Live URL works (test it now — last time before recording)

---

## Step 3: Record (10-20 min)

Open Loom: https://www.loom.com/

Loom sharing help: https://loomhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002208157-How-to-share-your-recording

Settings:
- Screen + face camera
- HD quality
- Public link (or "Anyone with the link can view")

Hit record. Follow your demo plan. **Don't restart for small mistakes** — keep them in.

Recommended takes: 2. First is rehearsal. Second is the keeper.

Stop at 5 min if you can. Longer = nobody watches.

---

## Step 4: Get The Loom URL (2 min)

Loom uploads automatically. After a minute, you'll get a shareable URL.

Test it: paste the URL into an incognito browser. **You should see:** your demo playing, no login required.

If it's private: change permissions to "Anyone with the link."

---

## Step 5: Save Demo Info (3 min)

Ask the orchestrator to add claim data to `.onemillion/state.json`:

```markdown
# Day 18 — Demo Day Submission

**Builder Name:** [your display name — real name, alias, or handle]
**Product Name:** [your product]
**Live URL:** [yourapp.com or .vercel.app]
**Demo Loom URL:** [your public Loom link]
**GitHub Repo:** [optional]
**Cohort:** [Cohort 0 / self-serve / Cohort 1 / etc.]
**Graduated At:** [today's date]

## My 18-Day Summary
[Optional 2-3 sentences on what you built and what you learned]
```

---

## Step 6: Final Verification

```bash
claude
```

Ask your harness to run the OneMillion verifier for this day.

This runs the FINAL check:
- Loom URL works
- Live URL works
- All 17 previous days verified
- Demo.md exists

If pass: Claude will generate the verified submission data you need for review. Your official Builder #N is assigned after the claim is accepted.

---

## Step 7: Submit Your Builder Application

Open the [Builder Claim Submission](../../docs/builder-claim.md) page. It lists the exact fields for the final form and the GitHub fallback.

**Preferred path — Builder Claim Form:**

If your cohort, live session, or Sid gave you a Google Form link, submit the claim packet there first. The form should ask for your live URL, Loom URL, GitHub/course fork, verification summary, and Builder Wall consent.

**Current public fallback — GitHub Builder Claim issue:**

1. Open Builder Claim issue chooser: https://github.com/siddsdixit/teach-one-million/issues/new/choose
2. Choose **Builder Claim**
3. Paste the verified claim packet from [Builder Claim Submission](../../docs/builder-claim.md)
4. Include your live URL, Loom URL, repo URL if public, and short build summary
5. Submit the issue

Sid reviews claims manually until Builder Wall automation is live. Accepted claim = official Builder #N.

---

## Step 8: Share The Win

LinkedIn or X:

- LinkedIn post composer: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/
- Sid's LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddharthdixit
- X post composer: https://x.com/compose/post

```
🎉 Builder #[N] reporting in.

I shipped [product] in 18 days through OneMillion.

It does [one specific outcome].

Live at [URL]. 

Demo: [Loom URL]

#BuildingWith1M
```

Tag @SidDixit. The Builder Wall thanks you.

## What Should Be True After Day 18

- [ ] 5-min Demo Loom recorded + public
- [ ] `.onemillion/state.json` includes claim data with URLs
- [ ] All 18 days verified
- [ ] Builder Claim form or GitHub fallback submitted for review
- [ ] Account setup QA passed from [Account Setup Playbook: Day 18](../../docs/account-setup.md#day-18-loom--builder-claim)
- [ ] You shared on LinkedIn (or you'll share within 24 hours)
- [ ] You took 10 minutes to actually feel what you accomplished

---

## Update Orchestrator State

Before you close today, ask the orchestrator to update `.onemillion/state.json`:

- **Current day:** Day 18 complete
- **Last verified day:** Day 18
- **Current blocker:** None, or the exact blocker to resume from
- **Next smallest action:** Submit your Builder Claim and keep building.

If verification did not pass yet, keep **Last verified day** at the previous passed day and write the blocker clearly.

## If You Are Stuck

Open your coding harness from your project folder:

```bash
claude
```

Paste this:

```text
I am on OneMillion Day 18.

Here is the step I was trying to complete:
[paste the step heading or instructions]

Here is what happened:
[paste the error, terminal output, or describe what I see]

Diagnose the likely cause and give me the next smallest action.
Do not rewrite unrelated code.
Ask for one missing detail at a time if needed.
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Loom recording failed mid-way | Save what you have, append the rest, or re-record. 2-take rule. |
| Loom is taking forever to upload | Often Loom processes in background. Refresh dashboard in a few min. |
| Live URL broke right before recording | Probably an env var issue. Fix it. Test again. Then record. |
| Can't decide on display name | Use your real name. Builder #N is a serious credential — fake names dilute it. |
| Demo went over 5 min | Re-record. Tighter script. 5 min is the rule. |
| GitHub repo is private and I want to keep it private | That's fine. Skip the github_repo field in your submission. Live URL + demo Loom are enough. |

## You're Done

Take this moment.

You spent 18 days. You built a real product. You shipped it to the internet. Real people have seen it. You earned a verified submission.

The next person reading this is starting their Day 1 today. They have no idea what they're capable of. **You used to be them. Three weeks ago.**

The skill is yours forever. The product is yours forever. After review, the number is yours forever.

The million starts with one. You're one of them.
