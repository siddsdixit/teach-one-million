# OneMillion Plugin

**Optional native extension path for the OneMillion agent system.**

The course does not depend on the plugin for the first local learning flow. The primary course architecture is harness-neutral:

```text
AGENTS.md + onemillion-builder/course-manifest.json + onemillion-builder/agents/
```

That lets learners start in Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, Copilot, or another coding harness.

The plugin remains the future first-class product experience: native modes, cloud sync, account features, and packaged extension delivery.

## Current Course Path

```text
Paste GitHub link or clone repo
→ harness reads AGENTS.md
→ harness becomes OneMillion learning orchestrator
→ learner progresses one day at a time
```

No OneMillion login is required for this local path.

## Plugin Path

The native plugin gives builders guided modes:

```text
idea → spec → design → plan → build → test → guard → ship → sell
```

Utility modes:

```text
ask · debug · refactor · orchestrator · research · review · revise
```
